# Running Dataverse on Kubernetes

This project aims to provide a simple to re-use example on how to run
Dataverse on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a running and fully configured Kubernetes cluster either
using OpenShift, Minikube, a full-fledged Cluster, GKE or similar.

## Usage

T.B.D.

## Future plans and ideas

At a later point in time, an [Operator](https://coreos.com/operators/) might be
added for even easier usage.
