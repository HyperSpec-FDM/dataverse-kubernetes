# Running Dataverse on Kubernetes

This project aims to provide a simple to re-use example on how to run
Dataverse on a Kubernetes cluster.

**NOTE:** all Docker images in this project work for released versions of
Dataverse only!

## Prerequisites

You'll need a running and fully configured Kubernetes cluster either
using OpenShift, Minikube, a full-fledged Cluster, GKE or similar.

## Usage

T.B.D.

## Future plans and ideas

At a later point in time, an [Operator](https://coreos.com/operators/) might be
added for even easier usage.

The docker images should at some point be moved into the upstream code,
so they can be build and used for development purposes, too.
