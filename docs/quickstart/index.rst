Our quick to start demos provide showcases what Dataverse can do for you.
Currently pre-packaged to be run on your local machine:

- Using ``minikube``, see :doc:`minikube`
- Using ``k3s``, see :doc:`k3s`
- Using ``docker-compose``, see :doc:`docker-compose`

:ref:`day3/objectstore:Minio Example Demo` bases on these, but includes
integrating an S3 compatible object store, too.
