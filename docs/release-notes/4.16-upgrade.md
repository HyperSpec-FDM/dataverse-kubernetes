This release contains references to the [upstream release 4.16](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/releases/tag/v4.16) and will deploy it when used.

## Pre-Deploy Actions
No special action seems to be necessary regarding to the upstream release docs.

## Post-Deploy Actions
- The core bundled `citation` metadata block has changed. If you are upgrading
  from an older release, you will need to upload the new schema and reexport.
  Please see [metadata docs](docs/metadata.md) on how to do that.

None the less, please take a look at the rest of upstream release notes, too.

## General Notes
Please be aware that future enhancements to scripting and more used to deploy and configure Dataverse will not be added to the release. Thus docker images for this will not be updated.

This is especially important in terms of security patches for images. This might change in the future with scheduled builds from CI.

Please be aware, that tagged images are not automatically updated by Kubernetes when updated on Docker Hub (image pull policy).
