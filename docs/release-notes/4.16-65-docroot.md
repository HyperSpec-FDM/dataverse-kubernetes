# Persistance for dataverse logos, sitemap, etc
Since this release, Dataverse will save logos for dataverses, its sitemap
and other statefull information at `/docroot` of the container. See #65.

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` and volume mount has been added. For now this is
in `ReadWriteOnce` mode. For using it with a scaled, multi-instance deployment,
that should be changed to `ReadWriteMany`. See also #10.
