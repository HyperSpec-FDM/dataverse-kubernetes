.. todo::
  This needs yet to be refactored. Goals are missing, a vision is absent.

- At a later point in time, an [Operator](https://coreos.com/operators/) might be added for even easier usage.

- The docker images should at some point be moved into the upstream code,
  so they can be build and used for development purposes, too.
  See also [issue 5292](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/5292) on this.

- This should support testing S3 remote file storage with Minio out of the box.
