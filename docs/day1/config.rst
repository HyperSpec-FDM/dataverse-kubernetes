Configuration
=============

.. warning::

  | **DO. NOT. SET. ANY. PASSWORDS. IN. ENVIRONMENT. VARIABLES.**
  | Use ``Secrets`` for this. See :doc:`day1/secrets`.

For usage on Kubernetes, all configuration can be stored in a ``ConfigMap``.

Configuring Dataverse is done in multiple ways:

#.  Database connection, mail gateway, bootstrap values, etc used in scripts
    are read from environment variables directly.

    * Use these variable names in your ``ConfigMap``.
    * See :ref:`default.config` for a list of these special ones.

#.  Things like file storage, networking, most DOI, etc are all *basic system settings*
    and can be set via Java system properties, residing in the Glassfish domain configuration.

    * See :ref:`JVM Options <jvm-options>` on how to configure these.
    * See `Dataverse Installation Guide: JVM options <http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html#jvm-options>`_
      for a complete list of all available options.

#.  More options are stored in the database and configured via API and/or UI.

    * See :ref:`Database Settings <database-settings>` on how to configure these.
    * See `Dataverse Installation Guide: Database settings <http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html#database-settings>`_
      for an exhaustive list of all available options.

.. note::

  All of this should be streamlined into an easier to use configuration system.
  See https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/issues/5293 for more. Please leave a
  comment there if you feel the same.




.. _jvm-options:

System Properties: JVM options
------------------------------
The basic idea is to map environment variables to Java system properties each
time a Dataverse container starts with the default entrypoint (being the application
server).

1. Simply pick a `JVM option <http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html#jvm-options>`_
   from the list and replace "." with "_" ("-" is not allowed in env var names!).
2. Put the transformed name as a key into the ``ConfigMap.data``.
3. Add your value. Be sure to use simple strings only - no numbers, no complex types. Escape with ``" "``.

.. note::

  Currently some JVM options have dashes in them, which is no allowed character for
  an environment variable. As a workaround, replace any dash with `__`. It will
  be transformed back into `-` internally when the container starts. See example below.



Examples (:ref:`full example <configmap>`):

.. literalinclude:: examples/configmap.yaml
    :lines: 16-18,26-27,34



.. warning::

  **DO NOT USE THIS FOR PASSWORDS!** Those are done via Kubernetes ``Secrets``, see :doc:`day1/secrets`.





.. _database-settings:

Database Options: Using ``curl``
--------------------------------

As database settings are persistent in, well, the database, they don't need
to get set everytime the container starts. To be consistent and easy to use,
the same `ConfigMap` used for JVM options can be used for these settings,
but you need to create a `Job` or even a `CronJob` to apply them.

*Note:* Of course you can choose to use your own tools and scripts for this.
Basically its just `curl` calls to the Admin API.

#### Provide a setting

1. Pick a [Database setting](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/installation/config.html#database-settings)
2. Remove the `:` and replace it with `db_`. Keep the Pascal case!
3. Put the transformed value into the `ConfigMap` `.data`.
4. Add your value, which can be any value you see in the docs. Keep in mind:
   when you need to use JSON, format it as a string!

Example:
```yaml
---
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dataverse
  labels:
    app: dataverse
data:
  # Skipping JVM options here. See above.
  db_SystemEmail: "Ghostbusters <slimer@buh.net>"
  db_Languages: '[{ "locale":"en", "title":"English" }, { "locale":"fr", "title":"Fran√ßais" }]'
```
**DO NOT USE THIS FOR PASSWORDS OR KEYS!** Those are done via k8s secrets, see below.

#### Delete a setting
When you need to **delete** a setting, just provide an *empty* value.

#### Apply settings
Remember: you will need to update the `ConfigMap` when you want to apply changes.
You need to think about in which file you keep the map - having it in two locations
is a bad idea. It's always a good idea to put it in revision control.

```
# Update ConfigMap:
kubectl apply -f k8s/dataverse/configmap.yaml
# Deploy a new config job:
kubectl create -f k8s/dataverse/jobs/configure.yaml
```

You might consider providing a `CronJob` for scheduled, regular updates.




Example ``ConfigMap``
---------------------

Below you can find an example ``ConfigMap`` using all three types of variables:

.. literalinclude:: examples/configmap.yaml
    :caption: configmap.yaml
    :name: configmap
    :language: yaml

Sane defaults: ``default.config``
---------------------------------

Some things need sane defaults, which can be found in :ref:`default.config` (see below).
You might find those usefull as an example for your personally tuned `ConfigMap`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../docker/dataverse-k8s/glassfish/bin/default.config
    :caption: default.config
    :name: default.config
    :language: shell
